Each algorithm has its own README.md inside the directory with a detailed explanation.

## Roadmap
* Competing algorithm
* Sorting CLI
* YouTube explainer video & code walkthrough

## Project structure
Each sorting algorithm is contained in its respective directory.
* \*\*_sort.py (actual algorithm)
* util.py (utility functions - not required for sorting algorithm)
* README.md
